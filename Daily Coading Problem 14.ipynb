    "Monte Carlo methods rely on random sampling. In this case, if we take a cartesian plane and inscribe a circle with radius r inside a square with lengths 2r, then the area of the circle will be πr2 while the area of the square will be (2r)2 = 4r2. Then, the ratio of the areas of the circle to the square is π / 4.\n",

    "So, what we can do is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Set r to be 1 (the unit circle)\n",
    "* Randomly generate points within the square with corners (-1, -1), (1, 1), (1, -1), (-1, 1)\n",

    "       * You can check whether a point (x, y) is inside the circle if x2 + y2 < r2, which is another way of                representing a circle\n",
    "* Divide the number of points that fall inside the circle to the total number of points -- that should give us an   approximation of π / 4."
